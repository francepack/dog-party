DOG PARTY
Dog party is a website about some dogs that like to party. Most dogs like to party. Perhaps some breeds I'd consider 'obnoxious' do not like to party, but we will not dwell on that. This website is devoted to those dogs that DO like to party. If you, the user, have or know a dog that likes to party, you may type the name of that party animal into the text box, and watch as your party animal's name appears in the title of the webpage. Neat, right? (As of now, javaScript has not been added)

This is my first assignment for Turing school. In this assignment, we recieved a website comp to replicate as best we could as an itroduction to HTML/CSS. Additional challenges were to design a page that looks decent to a mobile viewer, and also to add javaScript that interacts with the input box, making the entered text appear in place of 'Some Dogs' in the title above.

Here is a screenshot of the site:
