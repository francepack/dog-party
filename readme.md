# Dog Party
Dog-party is the first assigned project of Turing School, built using HTML and CSS. We were asked to replicate a comp to practice what we have learned about HTML & CSS. We were not allowed to use css flex or grid. Additionally, we were challenged to design a page that will be viewable by a mobile user.

#### What I gained from dog-party
Making this webpage helped me started conceptualize when to give class names to elements and when structural tags are needed versus when they are not. I also worked through quite a bit of trial and error positioning items on the page with CSS, and needed to research a few areas not covered in class, the main thing being figuring out how to darken the background image in the top portion of the page.
