# Dog Party
Dog-party is the first assigned project of Turing School, built using HTML and CSS. We were asked to replicate a comp to practice what we have learned about HTML & CSS. We were not allowed to use css flex or grid. Additionally, we were challenged to design a page that will be viewable by a mobile user.

#### What I gained from dog-party
Making this webpage helped get me started thinking particularly about assigning classes and when it may be handy to create tags for sections vs when that may be unnecessary. I had to work through quite a bit of trial and error positioning items on the page with CSS, and tried to thoughtfully research some areas we hadn't covered in class, the main thing being darkening the background image in the top portion of the page. I tried to clean up my code, though I suspect there is more to do/learn, and CSS code usage is not preferred technique, rather more patch-work.
