# DOG PARTY
Dog-party is a webpage built using HTML and CSS. I hope to add some JavaScript functionality soon.

Dog-Party is the first assigned project for Turing school. We were asked to replicate a website comp to practice what we have learned about HTML & CSS. Additionally, we were challenged to design a page that will be viewable by a mobile user, and also to write javaScript that interacts with the input box, making the entered text appear in place of 'Some Dogs' in the title above. As of now, I have not added the JavaScript.
#### What I gained from dog-party
Making this webpage helped get me started thinking particularly about assigning classes and when it may be handy to create tags for sections vs when that may be unnecessary. I had to work through quite a bit of trial and error positioning items on the page with CSS, and tried to thoughtfully research some areas we hadn't covered in class, the main thing being darkening the background image in the top portion of the page. I tried to clean up my code, though I suspect there is more to do/learn, and CSS code usage is not preferred technique, rather more patch-work. 
#### Screenshots
Here is a screenshot of the comp I attempted to recreate:
